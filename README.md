### Hi and welcome!

My name is Adrian, I'm a Master's of Data Science Student at USF. Here are some interesting projects I've worked on:

- 🗺️ A full-stack [webapp](https://site.hspa.info) as part of the LA Streets project by City of Los Angeles and UCLA
- 🔒 A Computer-Use powered authentication system [WeGotcha](https://github.com/AdrianLamLH/WeGotcha) built with FastAPI/Uvicorn that exploits motion blur artifacts to achieve 70% lower false-negative rates compared to traditional CAPTCHAs
- 🦆 An AI-based recursive project management [platform](https://rub-a-duck.vercel.app/) using LLM-powered knowledge graphs to automatically decompose complex projects into actionable subtasks, built with React and Tailwind CSS

You can check out my [personal website](https://adrianlhlam.vercel.app/) for more details if you're interested in what I've done.
