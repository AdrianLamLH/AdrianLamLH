### Hi and welcome!

My name is Adrian, I'm a Mathematics of Computation Student at UCLA. Here are some interesting projects I've worked on:

- 🗺️ A full-stack [webapp](https://site.hspa.info) as part of the LA Streets project by City of Los Angeles and UCLA
- 💭 A re-imagining of the popular [Wordle webapp](https://github.com/trungvu08/Wordle-PLUS) built on the MERN stack for players looking for an extra challenge
- 🌐 A Geometric Neural Network machine learning [model](https://github.com/AdrianLamLH/Wiki-CS-GNN-model-explainer) for using a content-based approach in generating hyperlinks between Wikipedia articles

You can check out my [personal website](https://adrianlhlam.vercel.app/) for more details if you're interested in what I've done.
