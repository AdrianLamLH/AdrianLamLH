### Hi and welcome!

My name is Adrian, I'm a Master's of Data Science Student at USF. Here are some interesting projects I've worked on:

- üó∫Ô∏è A full-stack [webapp](https://site.hspa.info) as part of the LA Streets project by City of Los Angeles and UCLA
- üìù [ShorthandTF](https://github.com/AdrianLamLH/ShorthandTF) - A CNN-LSTM-Transformer hybrid model for optical recognition of shorthand writing with multi-head attention and custom CTC decoding, achieving 78% character-level accuracy
- üîí A novel biometric authentication system [WeGotcha](https://github.com/AdrianLamLH/WeGotcha) leveraging proprietary computer vision algorithms to detect motion blur artifacts in user behavior patterns, built with FastAPI/Uvicorn backend and achieving 70% reduced false-negative rates over traditional CAPTCHAs while maintaining 100% immunity across 1000+ simulated attacks in Anthropic's security testing environment
- ü¶Ü An AI-based recursive project management [platform](https://rub-a-duck.vercel.app/) using LLM-powered knowledge graphs to automatically decompose complex projects into actionable subtasks, built with React and Tailwind CSS

You can check out my [personal website](https://adrianlhlam.vercel.app/) for more details if you're interested in what I've done.
